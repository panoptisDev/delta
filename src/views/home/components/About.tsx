                            could work within the realms of the protocol, please consider

                            Register is developed and maintained by LC Labs as the first dApp
                            to interact with the Reserve Protocol and various RTokens deployed
                            with the platform.

                            If an RToken is listed on Register, it doesn't mean that Reserve
                            or LC Labs endorses the safety or risk levels of the RToken. LC
                            Labs requires Github requests with additional information beyond
                            what is available on the blockchain to give users relevant data to
                            make informed decisions. As a user, please evaluate any new RToken
                            carefully before holding or staking your RSR on them.
